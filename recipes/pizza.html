    <h3 class="short">A delicious flatbread topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and various toppings, baked to perfection.</h3>
    <p>Pizza is a beloved dish that originated in Italy and has become popular worldwide. It consists of a round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, olives, vegetables, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
    <p>There are countless variations of pizza, from the classic Margherita with fresh basil to more adventurous toppings like barbecue chicken or vegan cheese. It's a versatile dish that can be customized to suit any taste.</p>
