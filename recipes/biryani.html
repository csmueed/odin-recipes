    <img src="../img/biryani.jpg" class="img" alt="Biryani Image">
    <h3 class="short">A fragrant rice dish layered with spiced meat or veggies, cooked to perfection with herbs, saffron, and deep flavors.</h3>
    <p>Biryani is a bold and aromatic rice-based dish that brings together perfectly cooked basmati rice, marinated meat (like chicken, beef, or mutton), or vegetables, all infused with a blend of warm spices like cumin, cardamom, and cloves. It’s often layered and slow-cooked (dum style), allowing the flavors to meld together beautifully.</p>
    <p>It’s a centerpiece meal in South Asian cuisine, often served during festivals, family gatherings, and celebrations. Whether it’s Hyderabadi, Karachi-style, or a homemade fusion, biryani always hits hard with flavor and tradition.</p>
